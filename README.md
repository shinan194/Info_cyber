## information security vs cyber security

|**Information security (Infosec)**

- Protection of *all forms of information* (digital or physical) from unauthorized access, modification, om
- Broader - includes *data in any form (printed, spoken, written, or electronic).
- Ensure **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of information, regardless of medium.
- Data protection (physical & digital).
-  Paper documents

## Cyber security
- Protection of *digital assets, systems, networks, and data* from cyberattacks originating through the internet or  other digital means.
- Narrower - focuses specifically on *digital and network-based threats*
- Protect *computers, networks, servers, and data* from online attacks, breaches and malware.
- system and network defense (digital only)

 ## simplified understanding
 information security = protection all kinds of information
- digital + physical


## Example comparison
| *Situation*                                          | *Infosec View*                                                | *Cybersecurity view*
| ---------------------------------------------        | ------------------------------------------------------------  | --------------------------------------------------- 
| A hacker steals customer database from a website     | Concerned about *loss of confidentiality* of customer data    | Concerned about *how the hacker breached the server* and *network vulnerabilities*
| Employee prints confidential data and leaks it       | *Handled under Infosec* (physical data breach)                | Not considered a *cyber* issue (no digital attack involved)

inshort:
cybersecurity is a subset of information security
